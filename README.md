REDR - RAW EXIF Date Renamer

A script with a simple task to complite: to rename files .arw or .jpg to 'YYYY_MM_DD_HH_MM_SS' pattern name.

Made by simple intention to organize personal library of raw photos collected over 10+ years.

Although there is a lot of software which can do batch renaming with applied pattern - this is my trainng in code and GitHub activities.
